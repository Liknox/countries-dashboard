# About Countries Project

### This app uses Vite, React, Redux ( middleware, persistence, and thunk ) and API ( axios ) requests.

It lists all countries and can be sorted by continent. Users can search for a country and get more information on a specific country, including neighboring countries, via API requests. The interface can be customized with different color schemes. 

It's a simple and intuitive tool to search for countries.
