# About Countries app

#### This web application is built using Vite, React, Redux... (redux-middleware, redux-persist, redux-thunk)

On the main page of the application, users are presented with a list of all countries in the world. This list can be sorted by continent, making it easy for users to find countries in specific regions. Additionally, users can search for a particular country by name using a search bar, which filters the list based on the user's input.

When a user clicks on a country from the list, they are taken to a page that provides more information about that country. This information includes a short description of the country, along with basic facts such as its population, capital city, currency and official language. Users can also see a list of the country's neighboring countries (also click on them), allowing them to learn more about the region in which the country is located.

To obtain this information, the application makes use of API requests. Specifically, it utilizes a public API that provides data on countries around the world. This API is called by the application whenever a user selects a country from the list or performs a search.

Finally, the application provides users with the ability to customize the color scheme of the interface. By toggling between different color options, users can personalize their viewing experience and make the application more visually appealing to them.

Overall, this project is designed to be a simple and intuitive way for users to search countries around the world. With its clean interface, sort functions, and customizable color scheme, it provides a fast and efficient way for users to access information about different countries and regions.
